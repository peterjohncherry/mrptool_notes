The program is intended to help with evaluation of the many index expressions
which arise in multi-reference perturbation theory.  Essentially, it aims to
evaluate one of the following three kinds of expressions, the simplest of which
is
\begin{equation}
\langle M | \hat{X} \hat{Y} ... | N \rangle,
\label{eqn:basic}
\end{equation}
\noindent here $\hat{X}$ and $\hat{Y}$ are some arbitrary operators, and $| N
\rangle$  is a multireference wavefunction represented as a linear combination
of determinants, $|I\rangle $;
\begin{equation}
|N\rangle = \sum_{I} c_{I}^{N}| I \rangle.
\end{equation} 
\noindent Written using second quantization (\ref{eqn:basic}) would be
\begin{equation}
\sum_{\substack{ x_{1}x_{2}...\\ y_{1}y_{2}... \\ ...}} X_{x_{1}x_{2}...} Y_{y_{1}y_{2}...} ...
\sum_{I}\sum_{J}
\langle I | a^{\dagger}_{x_{1}} a_{x_{2}}...a^{\dagger}_{y_{1}}a_{y_{2}}....| J \rangle 
 c^{M \dagger}_{I}c^{N}_{J}.
\label{eqn:basic_2nd_quantized}
\end{equation}
\noindent  Here, $X_{x_{1},x_{2}...}$ and $Y_{y_{1},y_{2}...}$ are just representations of operators 
$\hat{X}$ and $\hat{Y}$ in the molecular orbital basis.\\

\noindent It is also possible to calculate derivatives of (\ref{eqn:basic_2nd_quantized})  with respect to CI-coefficients, $c_{I}^{N}$;
\begin{equation}
\sum_{\substack{ x_{1}x_{2}...\\ y_{1}y_{2}... \\ ...}} X_{x_{1}x_{2}...} Y_{y_{1}y_{2}...} ...
\sum_{J}
\langle I | a^{\dagger}_{x_{1}} a_{x_{2}}...a^{\dagger}_{y_{1}}a_{y_{2}}....| J \rangle 
c^{N}_{J}
\label{eqn:ci_derivative}
\end{equation}
\noindent In a similar vein, it is possible to evaluate expressions of form:
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{\substack{ x_{1}x_{2}...\\ y_{1}y_{2}... \\ ...}} X_{x_{1}x_{2}...} Y_{y_{1}y_{2}...} ...
\sum_{\Omega}
\sum_{I}\sum_{J}
\langle I | \hat{E}^{\dagger}_{\Omega} a^{\dagger}_{x_{1}} a_{x_{2}}...a^{\dagger}_{y_{1}}a_{y_{2}}....| J \rangle 
 c^{M \dagger}_{I}c^{N}_{J}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation}
=
\sum_{\substack{ x_{1}x_{2}...\\ y_{1}y_{2}... \\ ...}} X_{x_{1}x_{2}...} Y_{y_{1}y_{2}...} ...
\sum_{I}\sum_{J}
\langle I | a_{\omega_{1}} a_{\omega_{2}}.. .a^{\dagger}_{x_{1}} a_{x_{2}}...a^{\dagger}_{y_{1}}a_{y_{2}}....| J \rangle 
 c^{M \dagger}_{I}c^{N}_{J}
\label{eqn:basic_2nd_quantized_projector}
\end{equation}
\noindent where the $\hat{E}^{\dagger}_{\Omega}$ is a projection operator
which excites electrons into the virtual space, from the orbitals used to construct
the space in which the reference wavefunctions, $\{|N\rangle\}$, were originally defined.\\

\noindent The program is intended to be flexible; and instead of asking for
specific perturbation theories or properties the user has the option of
specifying algebraic expressions directly via the input file.\\

\noindent It is important to note that the program is intended to facilitate property 
calculations on wavefunctions obtained from multireference calculations. Hence it
is necessary to first run a CASSCF calculation before calling the program. Furthermore,
the program does not contain routines for evaluation of molecular orbital integrals;
when such integrals are needed it calls to the pre-existing routines in the 
Bagel~\cite{BAGEL} code.

\section{Structural outline}
\noindent The program is split into three main components; an algebraic manipulator, an FCI
iand linear algebra library (mainly consisting of routines for performing tensor contractions),
and a task translation module for facilitating communication between .\\

\begin{figure}[!ht]

initial order in which the components are used (looping may occur in the case of iterations).
The intention is that each component, with the exception of the driver, functions independently of the others.}
\end{center}
\label{fig:prog_structure}
\end{figure}

\noindent The algebraic manipulator interprets the expressions defined
in the input, and restructures these into a number of quantities which are
more suited to computational evaluation. To accomplish this the
algebraic manipulator makes extensive use of the commutation
relations of the creation and annihilation operators, as well as the physical
symmetries of the operators, in order to minimize the number of terms, and
avoid the need for calculation of terms which are likely to be computationally
expensive to evaluate (e.g., those with large numbers of indexes). This series
of expressions is used to form an algebraic task list; a sequence of
generic mathematical operations which are evaluated by other parts of the program.
It is important to note that the algebraic manipulator is entirely based around symbolic manipulation,
and does not handle any of the large data structures, e.g., CI-vectors,
molecular orbital integral tensors, etc.. The expressions in the algebraic
task list do not in any way specify what kind of data structures need to
be used to store the quantities necessary for their evaluation.\\

\noindent The FCI and tensor libraries contain generic routines for calculating
density matrices and their derivatives, and performing tensor contractions (and
other various tensor manipulations). The tensor and FCI library are completely
distinct from the algebraic manipulator, and operate totally independently. The
routines within the FCI library have a recursive structure, which 
enables calculation of density matrices (and
derivatives) of arbitrary order. In a similar vein, the tensor library can
operate on tensors of arbitrary order, with each dimension being a different
size. At present the FCI  library uses the Determinant class defined in
Bagel~\cite{BAGEL}. The tensor libraries make use of the SMITH::Tensor class
defined in Bagel, which in turn makes use of the TiledArray~\cite{TiledArray}
libraries for parallel storage of the data.  The routines in the tensor
arithmetic library are built using a combination of calls to
LAPACK~\cite{LAPACK}, and the tensor transposition routine defined in
TiledArray\footnote{ To clarify, whilst btas has some tensor contraction
routines, these were found to not be suitable for the current purpose, and are
not used.}.\\

\noindent The final major component of the program is the task translator,
which faciliates communication between the algebraic manipulator and the 
FCI and tensor libraries. This is necessary, as
neither the arithmetic component has knowledge of the classes used in
the algebraic manipulator, and vice versa. Whilst this has complicated the
design slightly, it should enable greater portability, as well as making the
program substantially easier to extend and upgrade.\\ 

\noindent In a sense there is a fourth component, a driving routine, which
performs some communication between the three routines, parsing of the input,
and some initialization. However, whilst this component is practically
important, and not particularly small, it is rather simple and of little
interest, so I will not discuss it significantly.

\section{Specific components}
The functioning of the program is best explained by example. In the following,
use of italicized words indicate that word is a class defined in the program.
The "highest level" class is the \emph{equation}, which determines what the
final output of the program is. For example, the user may ask the program to find the 
$\hat{T}^{LN}$ which satisfy 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{N} 
\langle M | \hat{E}^{\dagger}_{\Omega} (\hat{H}-\epsilon_{L}) \hat{T}^{LN} | N \rangle  +
\langle M | \hat{E}^{\dagger}_{\Omega} \hat{H} | L  \rangle = 0 \text{ \ \ \ \ } \forall \text{ \ \ }  M . 
\label{eqn:eqn_example}
\end{equation}
\noindent To accomplish this, the user will specify the equation in the input file, and the 
program will use the information to construct an \emph{equation} object. This is \emph{equation}
is then used to generate a number of \emph{expression} objects, which can be evaluated independently. 
For the equation specified by (\ref{eqn:eqn_example}) these \emph{expression} objects
may correspond to quantities such as
\begin{equation}
\sum_{N} 
\langle M | \hat{E}^{\dagger}_{\Omega} (\hat{H}-\epsilon_{L}) \hat{T}^{LN} | N \rangle  +
\langle M | \hat{E}^{\dagger}_{\Omega} \hat{H} | L  \rangle.
\label{eqn:Hylleras}
\end{equation}
\noindent Each \emph{equation} contains a number of such \emph{expression} objects, along with
information regarding how they relate to one another and the quantity requested by the user.
In a single instance of the \emph{expression} class corresponding to (\ref{eqn:Hylleras}),
the values of $L$ and $M$  would be set, whilst the range of
summation over $N$ would be defined. Note that unlike the equation the expression
contains no information about what the expression should be equal to.
Typically, an \emph{equation} will contain many \emph{expressions}, but
these will only differ from one another by the values of the indices, or the 
constraints placed on the ranges of summations. The motivation for this is to aid in parallelization;
as seperate expressions may be evaluated entirely independently from one another.\\

\noindent Each \emph{expression} is further broken down into a number of \emph{term}s.
\emph{Terms} differ from \emph{expressions} in that any state index summation in
in a \emph{term} applies to the entire term.
Hence (\ref{eqn:Hylleras}) cannot be represented by a single term object, and instead
requires two:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{N} 
\langle M | \hat{E}^{\dagger}_{\Omega} (\hat{H}-\epsilon_{L}) \hat{T}^{LN} | N \rangle  
\label{eqn:Hylleras1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\langle M | \hat{E}^{\dagger}_{\Omega} \hat{H} | L  \rangle  
\label{eqn:Hylleras2}
\end{equation}
\noindent Without this separation (\ref{eqn:Hylleras2}) would be summed over $N$ times,
despite the fact $N$ does not occur. 
Whilst this constraint seems needless and annoying there are justifications for them stemming
from the strategies, to be elaborated upon later in this document, used to merge different \emph{term}s together. \\ 

\noindent Each \emph{term} is further broken down into a list of \emph{braket}s. The \emph{term} 
in (\ref{eqn:Hylleras1}) would be broken down into $2N$ \emph{brakets}: 
\begin{equation}
\langle M | \hat{E}^{\dagger}_{\Omega} \hat{H} \hat{T}^{LN} | N \rangle  
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\langle M | \hat{E}^{\dagger}_{\Omega} (-\epsilon_{L}) \hat{T}^{LN} | N \rangle  
\end{equation}
\noindent Within a \emph{braket} the values of all the indexes are specified.
A single \emph{braket} consists of a bra and a ket, surrounding some many electron 
operator formed from the product of an arbitrary number of 1- and 2-electron operators.  The
individual \emph{braket}s comprising a \emph{term} are never\footnote{Excepting
the situation where a \emph{term} consists of a single \emph{braket}.}
evaluated independently; the arithmetic operations to evaluate \emph{braket}s
with common bra and ket will be merged together, provided these bra and ket
exist within the same term. Similarly, it is also possible to merge the compute
lists associated with different \emph{term}s together, though not the
\emph{term} objects themselves. However, this is not done by default, as
typically it is useful to store and evaluate \emph{term}s independently.\\

\noindent The remaining fundamental classes are the \emph{TensOps}, which contain
information regarding the second-quantized presentation of the operators, e.g.,
the tensor $\mathbf{H}$, with elements $H_{ijkl}$, where $i, j, k$ and $l$ are
molecular orbital indices. And the \emph{StatesInfo}, \emph{CIVecInfo}
classes, which contains information about which ci-sectors are used to represent the 
wavefunction, and which orbitals were used to construct these ci-sectors,  respectively.\\

\noindent The above described components are the targets upon which the 
algebraic manipulation routines act to generate the algebraic task list.
